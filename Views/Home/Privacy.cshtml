        <h2 style="color: darkred"> Technical Details</h2>
        <p>
            In this section, we'd like to highlight some key aspects of our transition to MVC and the technical prowess behind it:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Enhanced Structure:</strong> With the adoption of MVC, our website's codebase has been restructured into distinct components, each with its specific role. The Model represents the data and business logic, the View handles the presentation layer, and the Controller manages user input and application flow. This separation of concerns promotes modularity and simplifies code maintenance.
        </p>

        <p> <strong>Improved Scalability:</strong> MVC facilitates scalability by decoupling components and promoting code reuse. New features and functionalities can be seamlessly integrated without impacting existing code, allowing for agile development and rapid iteration.</p>

        <p><strong>Streamlined Development:</strong> By leveraging frameworks like ASP.NET MVC, Django, or Laravel, we've streamlined the development process. These frameworks provide built-in tools and conventions for common tasks, enabling developers to focus on implementing business logic rather than reinventing the wheel.</p>

        <p><strong>Testing and Debugging:</strong> MVC promotes test-driven development (TDD) and facilitates unit testing of individual components. This ensures the reliability and robustness of our codebase, reducing the occurrence of bugs and enhancing overall software quality.</p>
